👋 Hi, I’m @palathingal

👀 I’m interested in ASIC and FPGA design, post-silicon validation, and low-level hardware-software integration, including DMA driver development and Linux kernel programming.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in ASIC design with Skywater 130 PDK using OpenRoad, and working with RISC-V ISA-based processors and FPGA interfaces.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source EDA tools, FPGA validation frameworks, and efficient neural network implementations for hardware.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm fascinated by the intersection of hardware design and machine learning and am working on scaling neural network weights for ASIC integration.
